### PickleProgramming Fork
Original Repo: https://github.com/chinhodado/persona5_calculator
And heavily borrowing from: https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool

I forked this because, being the OCD JRPG fan that I am, I would like to add in the ability to input 6 skills you would like to have, and output a table of all the possible fusions that could result in those 6 skills. Then give the ability to filter based on level or certain stats.

However working through the project I realized that I was missing inheritance data for the demons in the original verision of the game, and that the traits were all translated differently from the localization of P5R, so I ended up scrapping almost the entire database from the original repo and went with Aqiou384's JSON data.

And now I have decided to scrap this entire project, rebuild it in angular. But I will keep this repo here for posterity.

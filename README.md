### PickleProgramming Fork
Original Repo: https://github.com/chinhodado/persona5_calculator

I forked this because, being the OCD JRPG fan that I am, I would like to add in the ability to input 6 skills you would like to have, and output a table of all the possible fusions that could result in those 6 skills. Then give the ability to filter based on level or certain stats.

However working through the project I realized that I was missing inheritance data for the demons in the original verision of the game so I got that (and a number of other things) from this repo: https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool
